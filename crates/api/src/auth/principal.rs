//! What an authenticated caller is, and how claims from any mechanism become
//! one.
//!
//! Every mechanism `authn_kit` ships — an OIDC ID token, a JWT access token, a
//! static API token, a machine grant — normalises what it learns into
//! [`IdentityClaims`]. This module holds the single conversion that turns those
//! into Invokr's own principal, so adding a mechanism never adds a second place
//! where "who is this?" is decided.
