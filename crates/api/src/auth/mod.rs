//! Invokr's `authn_kit` integration.
//!
//! `authn_kit` deliberately knows nothing about four things, each supplied here:
//!
//! * [`principal`] — what an authenticated caller is, and how claims become one
//! * [`scope`] — whether a route requires a credential at all
//! * [`legacy`] — the pre-OIDC shared key, kept only while callers migrate
//! * [`session`] — confining the login redirect to the dashboard
//! * [`setup`] / [`routes`] — assembling the stack and rendering its endpoints
//!
//! **Authentication only.** Invokr has no authorization layer: once a caller is
//! authenticated it reaches every org and every workspace. See
//! `.claude/tracking/invokr-authn-plan.md` §9.
