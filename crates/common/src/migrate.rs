//! Schema migrations for the `public` control plane, compiled into the binary.
//!
//! `sqlx::migrate!` reads `migrations/` at compile time and embeds each file's
//! SQL as a string literal, so the migrations travel inside the binary rather
//! than beside it. There is one version number — the image tag — and no way to
//! deploy code without the migrations it expects.
//!
//! This covers the control plane only. Per-workspace data tables are created at
//! runtime from `crates/common/migrations/workspace_v1.sql` when a workspace is
//! provisioned; see [`crate::db::workspaces`]. That file is deliberately not
//! part of this set.
