//! In-process dispatcher for `INTERNAL` endpoints.
//!
//! `INTERNAL` endpoints back invokr's own dogfooded jobs — work that runs
//! inside the worker pool rather than crossing a network boundary. The
//! endpoint `spec` carries a `task` discriminator; this dispatcher matches on
//! it and calls the matching Rust function, returning its result through the
//! same `DispatchResult` channel as HTTP/Kafka/Redis so the surrounding
//! pipeline (attempts, retries, metrics, dashboard) treats it identically.
//!
//! Today the only task is `"reaper"`: the per-schema CRON sweep that retires
//! expired CRON jobs and unschedules their pg_cron entries. By running it
//! through the regular execution pipeline, every sweep becomes a visible
//! execution in the workspace's own dashboard — self-monitoring via invokr.
