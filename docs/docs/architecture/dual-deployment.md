# Dual Deployment Modes

Kronos supports two deployment modes: **library mode** (embedded in-process, also called "embedded mode") and **service mode** (standalone REST API). Both modes expose the same API through the `KronosClient` trait, so call sites are transparent to the deployment mode — switching requires a change only at the construction site; call sites that use the `KronosClient` trait are unchanged.

## KronosClient Trait

The `KronosClient` trait abstracts over both deployment modes. It defines the full set of operations for managing Kronos resources:

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait KronosClient: Send + Sync {
    async fn upsert_secret(&self, schema_name: &str, name: &str, plaintext: &str) -> anyhow::Result<()>;
    async fn delete_secret(&self, schema_name: &str, name: &str) -> anyhow::Result<()>;
    async fn register_endpoint(&self, schema_name: &str, name: &str, endpoint_type: &str, spec: serde_json::Value, retry_policy: Option<serde_json::Value>) -> anyhow::Result<()>;
    async fn delete_endpoint(&self, schema_name: &str, name: &str) -> anyhow::Result<()>;
    async fn create_job(&self, schema_name: &str, endpoint: &str, input: serde_json::Value, max_attempts: i64, trigger: JobTrigger, idempotency_key: Option<&str>) -> anyhow::Result<String>;
    async fn provision_workspace(&self, schema_name: &str) -> anyhow::Result<()>;
    async fn cancel_job(&self, schema_name: &str, job_id: &str) -> anyhow::Result<()>;
    async fn get_execution(&self, schema_name: &str, execution_id: &str) -> anyhow::Result<Option<Execution>>;
}
```

| Method | Library Mode | Service Mode |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `upsert_secret` | Encrypts and writes directly to DB | POST/PUT to `/v1/secrets` |
| `delete_secret` | Deletes from DB | DELETE to `/v1/secrets/{name}` |
| `register_endpoint` | Upserts in DB | PUT/POST to `/v1/endpoints` |
| `delete_endpoint` | Deletes from DB | DELETE to `/v1/endpoints/{name}` |
| `create_job` | Inserts job + execution directly | POST to `/v1/jobs` |
| `provision_workspace` | Applies `workspace_v1.sql` template | POST to `/v1/orgs/{id}/workspaces` |
| `cancel_job` | Updates DB + unschedules pg_cron | POST to `/v1/jobs/{id}/cancel` |
| `get_execution` | Queries DB directly | GET to `/v1/executions/{id}` |

## JobTrigger Enum

Both modes accept the same `JobTrigger` enum for job creation:

```rust
pub enum JobTrigger {
    /// Fire immediately, create a QUEUED execution right away.
    Immediate,
    /// Fire at a specific future time.
    Delayed { run_at: DateTime<Utc> },
    /// Recurring CRON schedule.
    Cron {
        expression: String,
        timezone: String,
        starts_at: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,
        ends_at: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,
        first_run_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    },
}
```

## Library Mode (KronosLibraryClient)

Library mode embeds Kronos directly into your application process. It holds a caller-provided `PgPool` and accesses the database directly — no HTTP overhead.

### Creating a Library Client

```rust
use kronos_worker::KronosLibraryClient;

let client = KronosLibraryClient::new(
    pool,                    // caller-owned sqlx PgPool
    "sched_",                // table prefix (e.g. "sched_" → sched_jobs); "" for no prefix
    "64_hex_chars...",       // AES encryption key for secrets
    Some(http_client),       // optional reqwest client to reuse
)?;
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `pool` | `PgPool` | Caller-owned connection pool pointing at the same PostgreSQL instance |
| `table_prefix` | `&str` | Prefix for all Kronos tables. Pass the full prefix including trailing underscore (e.g. `"sched_"` → `sched_jobs`). `""` means no prefix. Only alphanumeric and underscore allowed. |
| `encryption_key` | `&str` | 64 hex-char AES-256 key for secrets; pass zeros if not using secrets |
| `http_client` | `Option<Client>` | Optional reqwest client to reuse the caller's connection pool |

### Provisioning a Workspace

In library mode, `provision_workspace()` applies the `workspace_v1.sql` template directly to the database, creating all workspace-scoped tables. The `{p}` placeholder in the template is replaced by `table_prefix` verbatim:

```rust
pub async fn provision_workspace(&self, schema_name: &str) -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    Ok(db::workspaces::provision_schema(&self.pool, schema_name, &self.ctx.table_prefix).await?)
}
```

:::info
In library mode, `provision_workspace()` only creates the tenant schema and tables. It does **not** insert into `public.organizations` or `public.workspaces` — those are managed by the caller. See [Library Mode Setup](../deployment/library-mode) for the full provisioning flow.
:::

### Starting the Worker

The library client can start a background worker directly via `start_worker()`, which returns a `WorkerHandle`:

```rust
use kronos_worker::{KronosLibraryClient, WorkerConfig};
use kronos_common::tenant::SchemaRegistry;

let client = KronosLibraryClient::new(pool, "sched_", &key, None)?;

let schema_provider = SchemaRegistry::new(client.pool().clone(), 30);

let handle = client.start_worker(schema_provider, WorkerConfig::default());
// Worker runs as a tokio task — call handle.shutdown() then handle.join().await on shutdown
```

`start_worker()` returns a `WorkerHandle` that owns its own `CancellationToken` and task handle:

```rust
impl WorkerHandle {
    /// Signal the worker to stop. Returns immediately.
    pub fn shutdown(&self);
    /// Wait for the worker task to finish.
    pub async fn join(self) -> anyhow::Result<()>;
}
```

:::note
In library mode, `provision_workspace()` does not insert into `public.workspaces`, so `SchemaRegistry` (which queries that table) won't find your workspace. Use a custom `SchemaProvider` that returns schemas from your own configuration. See [Library Mode Setup](../deployment/library-mode#schemaprovider) for details.
:::

### WorkerConfig

```rust
pub struct WorkerConfig {
    pub max_concurrent: usize,      // default: 50
    pub poll_interval_ms: u64,       // default: 200
    pub config_cache_ttl_sec: u64,  // default: 60
    pub secret_cache_ttl_sec: u64,  // default: 300
    pub shutdown_timeout_sec: u64,  // default: 30
}
```

## Service Mode (KronosHttpClient)

Service mode communicates with Kronos via the REST API. It's used when Kronos runs as a standalone service:

```rust
use kronos_worker::KronosHttpClient;

let client = KronosHttpClient::new(
    "http://localhost:8080".to_string(),  // base URL
    "dev-api-key".to_string(),            // API key
    "org_id".to_string(),                 // org ID
);
```

### Workspace Routing

Each request includes `x-org-id` and `x-workspace-id` headers for tenant routing:

```rust
fn with_workspace(&self, req: reqwest::RequestBuilder, schema_name: &str) -> reqwest::RequestBuilder {
    req.header("x-org-id", &self.org_id)
       .header("x-workspace-id", schema_name)
}
```

Kronos resolves the workspace by slug (the `schema_name` is used as the workspace slug). The `resolve_schema` function in `db/workspaces.rs` accepts both slug and workspace UUID.

### Provisioning in Service Mode

In service mode, `provision_workspace()` registers the workspace with Kronos by creating it via the API. The org must already exist (created by the operator):

```rust
async fn provision_workspace(&self, schema_name: &str) -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    let resp = self.authed(
        self.http_client.post(self.url(&format!("/orgs/{}/workspaces", self.org_id)))
    )
    .json(&serde_json::json!({ "name": schema_name, "slug": schema_name }))
    .send().await?;

    if status.is_success() || status.as_u16() == 409 {
        return Ok(());  // created or already exists
    }
    // ...
}
```

## When to Use Which Mode

| Criteria | Library Mode | Service Mode |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Latency** | Lowest (no HTTP overhead) | Higher (HTTP round-trip) |
| **Isolation** | Shared process with your app | Fully isolated service |
| **Scalability** | Scales with your app | Scales independently |
| **DB access** | Direct (shared pool) | Via API (Kronos owns its DB) |
| **Deployment** | Embedded in your binary | Separate process/container |
| **Multi-app** | Each app embeds Kronos | Single Kronos serves multiple apps |
| **Worker** | Started in-process via `start_worker()` | Kronos runs its own workers |

:::tip
**Library mode** is ideal when you want to add durable job scheduling to a single Rust application with minimal infrastructure. **Service mode** is better when multiple applications need to share a single Kronos deployment, or when you want to decouple Kronos's operational lifecycle from your application.
:::

## SchemaProvider Trait

The `SchemaProvider` trait tells the worker where to find the list of active workspace schemas. Kronos ships `SchemaRegistry` as the default implementation:

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait SchemaProvider: Send + Sync + 'static {
    async fn get_active_schemas(&self) -> Result<Vec<String>, sqlx::Error>;
}
```

### SchemaRegistry (Default)

`SchemaRegistry` queries Kronos's own `public.workspaces` table with a 30-second TTL cache:

```rust
let schemas: Vec<(String,)> = sqlx::query_as(
    "SELECT schema_name FROM public.workspaces WHERE status = 'ACTIVE'"
).fetch_all(&self.pool).await?;
```

### Custom SchemaProvider

For embedding scenarios where the host application maintains its own list of schemas, you can implement `SchemaProvider` to return schemas from your own source:

```rust
struct MyAppSchemaProvider {
    my_config: MyConfig,
}

#[async_trait]
impl SchemaProvider for MyAppSchemaProvider {
    async fn get_active_schemas(&self) -> Result<Vec<String>, sqlx::Error> {
        // Return schemas from your own configuration
        Ok(self.my_config.active_schemas.clone())
    }
}
```

## Table Prefix System

Both deployment modes support a table prefix to avoid collisions when Kronos tables share a schema with other application tables.

### The `tbl()` Function

In the codebase, table names are constructed using a prefix-aware `DbContext`:

```rust
let mut db = DbContext::new(&mut *conn, prefix);
// All queries use db.prefix to construct table names
```

### The `{p}` Placeholder in workspace_v1.sql

The `workspace_v1.sql` template uses `{p}` as a placeholder for the table prefix:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS {p}jobs (
    job_id  TEXT  NOT NULL DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()::TEXT,
    ...
);

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_{p}jobs_idempotency
    ON {p}jobs (endpoint, idempotency_key)
    WHERE idempotency_key IS NOT NULL;
```

At provisioning time, `{p}` is replaced with the `table_prefix` verbatim:
- Empty string (no prefix → `jobs`, `idx_jobs_idempotency`)
- `"sched_"` (e.g. → `sched_jobs`, `idx_sched_jobs_idempotency`)

```rust
// From db/workspaces.rs — provision_schema():
let ddl = WORKSPACE_SCHEMA_V1.replace("{p}", table_prefix);
```

:::info
The table prefix is validated to contain only alphanumeric characters and underscores. An empty prefix is valid and means no prefix is applied. Pass the full prefix including trailing underscore (e.g. `"sched_"`, not `"sched"`) to get `sched_jobs` instead of `schedjobs`.
