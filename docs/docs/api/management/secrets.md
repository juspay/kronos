# Secrets

Secrets are encrypted variables available in endpoint spec templates via the `{{secret.*}}` namespace. Unlike configs, secrets are **write-only** — the plaintext value is never returned in API responses. Secrets are encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM and decrypted in memory only at execution time.

This makes secrets suitable for storing API keys, passwords, tokens, and other sensitive credentials that endpoints need to authenticate with downstream services.

## Authentication and headers

All secret endpoints require:

```
Authorization: Bearer <api_key>
X-Org-Id: <org_id>
X-Workspace-Id: <workspace_id>
```

:::warning
Secret endpoints are tenant-scoped. Requests without `X-Org-Id` and `X-Workspace-Id` headers will be rejected.
:::

## Encryption

### At-rest encryption

Secrets are encrypted using AES-256-GCM before being stored in the database. The encryption key is provided via `TE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (a 64-character hex string representing a 32-byte key).

The encryption process:
1. A 12-byte random nonce is generated for each encryption
2. The plaintext is encrypted using AES-256-GCM with the nonce and key
3. The nonce is prepended to the ciphertext
4. The combined `nonce || ciphertext || tag` is stored as `BYTEA` in the `secrets` table

### In-memory decryption

The worker decrypts secrets at execution time when resolving `{{secret.*}}` templates. Decrypted values are held in memory and cached for a configurable TTL (default: 300 seconds, controlled by `TE_SECRET_CACHE_TTL_SEC`).

After the cache TTL expires, the decrypted value is evicted and the next request triggers a fresh decrypt from the database.

:::danger
**Never use the default encryption key in production.** The default `TE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is 64 zeros (`0000...0000`), which provides no security. Always set `TE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` to a strong, random 32-byte key. If the key is rotated, existing secrets encrypted with the old key cannot be decrypted.
:::

## Write-only design

Secrets are designed to be **write-only** — the plaintext `value` is accepted on create and update, but never returned in any API response. All secret responses use the `SecretResponse` struct, which omits the `value` and `encrypted_value` fields entirely:

| Returned | Not returned |
|----------|-------------|
| `name` | `value` (plaintext input) |
| `created_at` | `encrypted_value` (BYTEA stored in DB) |
| `updated_at` | |

This means:
- `POST /v1/secrets` accepts `value` in the request body but does not return it in the response
- `GET /v1/secrets` and `GET /v1/secrets/{name}` return only metadata
- `PUT /v1/secrets/{name}` accepts a new `value` but does not return it

## Template usage

Secrets are referenced in endpoint specs via `{{secret.*}}`:

```json
{
  "spec": {
    "url": "{{config.api_base_url}}/emails/welcome",
    "headers": {
      "Authorization": "Bearer {{secret.email_api_key}}"
    },
    "body_template": {
      "sender": "{{config.sender}}"
    }
  }
}
```

The `{{secret.email_api_key}}` template is resolved at execution time — the worker decrypts the secret value and substitutes it into the spec. The decrypted value is never logged or persisted.

See [Template resolution](../../core-concepts/templates) for full details.

## Fields

### Request fields (create/update)

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Unique secret name within the workspace |
| `value` | string | Plaintext secret value to encrypt and store (never returned in responses) |

### Response fields (all operations)

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Secret name |
| `created_at` | string (ISO 8601) | Creation timestamp |
| `updated_at` | string (ISO 8601) | Last update timestamp |

:::note
The `value` and `encrypted_value` fields are never present in API responses. Responses contain only metadata (`name`, `created_at`, `updated_at`).
:::

## Endpoints

### Create secret

```
POST /v1/secrets
```

Creates a new secret. The plaintext `value` is encrypted with AES-256-GCM before storage. Returns `409 Conflict` if a secret with the same name already exists.

**Request body:**

```json
{
  "name": "email_api_key",
  "value": "sk-your-api-key-here"
}
```

**Example:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/secrets \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer dev-api-key" \
  -H "X-Org-Id: org_3f8a2b1c-..." \
  -H "X-Workspace-Id: ws_5e2c8d9f-..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "email_api_key",
    "value": "sk-your-api-key-here"
  }'
```

**Response (`201 Created`):**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "name": "email_api_key",
    "created_at": "2026-06-20T10:30:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2026-06-20T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

:::note
Notice that the `value` field is absent from the response. The plaintext value is encrypted and stored, but never returned.
:::

**Error responses:**

| Status | Error | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `409` | `Conflict` | Secret with name already exists |
| `500` | `Internal` | Encryption failed (check `TE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is valid) |

---

### List secrets

```
GET /v1/secrets?limit={limit}&cursor={cursor}
```

Returns secret metadata with cursor-based pagination. **Values are never included.**

**Query parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `limit` | integer | 50 | Maximum number of items to return (max 100) |
| `cursor` | string | *(none)* | Pagination cursor from the previous response |

**Example:**

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/v1/secrets?limit=10" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer dev-api-key" \
  -H "X-Org-Id: org_3f8a2b1c-..." \
  -H "X-Workspace-Id: ws_5e2c8d9f-..."
```

**Response (`200 OK`):**

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "name": "email_api_key",
      "created_at": "2026-06-20T10:30:00Z",
      "updated_at": "2026-06-20T10:30:00Z"
    },
    {
      "name": "webhook_signing_secret",
      "created_at": "2026-06-20T10:35:00Z",
      "updated_at": "2026-06-20T10:35:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "cursor": "d2Vic2l0ZQ=="
}
```

When `cursor` is present in the response, there are more items available. When `cursor` is `null`, all items have been returned.

:::info
The list response contains only metadata. There is no way to retrieve secret plaintext values via the API — they can only be written, not read.
:::

---

### Get secret

```
GET /v1/secrets/{name}
```

Returns metadata for a single secret. **The value is never included.**

**Example:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/secrets/email_api_key \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer dev-api-key" \
  -H "X-Org-Id: org_3f8a2b1c-..." \
  -H "X-Workspace-Id: ws_5e2c8d9f-..."
```

**Response (`200 OK`):**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "name": "email_api_key",
    "created_at": "2026-06-20T10:30:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2026-06-20T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

**Error responses:**

| Status | Error | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `404` | `SecretNotFound` | Secret not found |

---

### Update secret

```
PUT /v1/secrets/{name}
```

Updates an existing secret's value. The new plaintext `value` is encrypted before storage. **The value is never returned in the response.**

**Request body:**

```json
{
  "value": "sk-new-rotated-api-key"
}
```

**Example:**

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/v1/secrets/email_api_key \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer dev-api-key" \
  -H "X-Org-Id: org_3f8a2b1c-..." \
  -H "X-Workspace-Id: ws_5e2c8d9f-..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "value": "sk-new-rotated-api-key"
  }'
```

**Response (`200 OK`):**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "name": "email_api_key",
    "created_at": "2026-06-20T10:30:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2026-06-20T11:45:00Z"
  }
}
```

**Error responses:**

| Status | Error | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `404` | `SecretNotFound` | Secret not found |
| `500` | `Internal` | Encryption failed |

:::tip
Secret value updates take effect after the worker's cache TTL expires (`TE_SECRET_CACHE_TTL_SEC`, default 300 seconds). To force an immediate update, restart the worker.
:::

---

### Delete secret

```
DELETE /v1/secrets/{name}
```

Deletes a secret. Returns `409 Conflict` if any endpoints reference this secret (checked via `has_dependent_endpoints`, which scans endpoint spec templates for `{{secret.{name}}}` references).

**Example:**

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/v1/secrets/email_api_key \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer dev-api-key" \
  -H "X-Org-Id: org_3f8a2b1c-..." \
  -H "X-Workspace-Id: ws_5e2c8d9f-..."
```

**Response (`204 No Content`):**

No response body.

**Error responses:**

| Status | Error | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `404` | `SecretNotFound` | Secret not found |
| `409` | `Conflict` | Secret is referenced by endpoints — remove or update the endpoint's spec templates first |

:::warning
You cannot delete a secret that is referenced by any endpoint. The `has_dependent_endpoints` check scans all endpoint spec templates (including `url`, `headers`, and `body_template` fields) for `{{secret.{name}}}` references. First update or delete the dependent endpoints, then delete the secret.
:::

## Security considerations

| Aspect | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| **Encryption algorithm** | AES-256-GCM (authenticated encryption) |
| **Key** | 32-byte key from `TE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (hex string) |
| **Nonce** | 12-byte random nonce per encryption, prepended to ciphertext |
| **Storage** | `encrypted_value` column (BYTEA) in the `secrets` table |
| **API responses** | `SecretResponse` struct — never includes `value` or `encrypted_value` |
| **In-memory cache** | Decrypted values cached for `TE_SECRET_CACHE_TTL_SEC` (default 300s) |
| **KMS integration** | `TE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` itself can be KMS-encrypted (see [KMS](../../deployment/kms)) |

:::tip
For defense in depth, enable [AWS KMS integration](../../deployment/kms) to encrypt `TE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` itself at rest. This means the encryption key is never stored in plaintext in the environment — it's decrypted from KMS ciphertext at startup.
